### Hi there 👋

My name is Mauro (MAHW-roh), a software engineer from Argentina with eight years of professional experience in software development-- most of them working in the Banking and FinTech industries. Over these years, I have been developing and architecting solutions with different stacks, such as #aspnetcore, #python, #sql-server, #mongodb, #rabbitmq and #redis for communication between services and #redis for caching techniques.

I am a fast learner and a self-starter person with a strong passion for technology.

## Taking about personal stuff:
